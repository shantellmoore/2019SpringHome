# 2019SpringHome
##This is my last semester in school so I would say I am slightly experienced in Computer Science. My undergrad major was pure mathematics with a minor in deaf studies. Going hand in hand with my experience, I have not taken a lot of programming classes. I took computer systems with Fialkow last semester, programming and data structures, functional programming and cloud computing. All of my other classes were database design and management related. In terms of projects, for cloud computing, we had to make an application using Google App Engine along with a website that would work with the application.  From that I learned Python and a bit of HTML.


###After taking cloud computing and developing my application, I knew this class would be up my alley. I think the concept of being able to create web pages while being able to access and manage databases is really amazing. I am still not sure of what I want to do in the near future, but working with databases and creating websites has always peaked my interest. Unlike all my math experience, I am hoping to learn things in this class that is actually relevant to the “outside world”. I want to get through problems in this class the way I would if I were solving problems in my future job. I look forward expanding my horizons in this class.
